# Tefa

Report issues with essential services (Power, Water, Health, Fire, and the Police) within Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.

Get quick centralized access to emergency phone numbers.

I built this webapp with my buddy [Samuel](https://github.com/samwolde). He handled the backend for this project.

We used this project to learn a few things. On my side, my plan was to learn the following:
- [React Query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/) - data fetching, synchronization, and cache management
- [Making a PWA](https://web.dev/progressive-web-apps/)
- [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) - map integration
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth) - authentication
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - I wanted to use it in production
